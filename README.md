# breads
Express full CRUD with SSR JSX

## To Do
- make a glossary of terms for variables and names
- make cute bread art

### Things I learned
- Only forms can make requests that are not GET
- RESEARCH splice
- "You should see our bread data passed into the form. We now will update the name and hasGluten properties. When you press submit, you will notice the page refreshes. This is the default behavior of forms without a set method and action. Therefore, we need to set our method and action attributes." part 5
